	<h3>Conventions Used</h3>
	<p>
		The execution of the TestScript resources contained in this folder are constrained by the following
		conventions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Fixtures</b> - All resource reference values can be either url paths or local local file system
			paths. The convention for these TestScript resources use local file system paths where the
			execution engine is expected to resolve this path based on the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Leading '/' character - this is resolved as an absolute path based on a known root path
				</li>
				<li>
					No leading '/' character - this is resolved as a relative path based on the location of the
					TestScript resource file
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>FHIR Connectathon 11 Testing - Orlando, FL - January 2016</h2>
	<h3>Track 2 - Terminology Services</h3>
	<p>
		The TestScript resources in this folder represent a conversion** of the TestScript originally used at the
		1st Terminology Services Connectathon held in Washington, February 2014.
	</p>
	<p>
		The original single TestScript has been separated into four (4) separate TestScript definitions - one for
		each original test suite. In addition, each of those TestScripts have two variations based on whether the
		FHIR client or server assigns the resource id of the required ValueSet resources created in the setup.
	</p>
	<h4>FHIR Resource ID Assigned by the Client</h4>
	<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1">
		<tr style="background-color:lightgray"><td><b>TestScript Name</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
		<tr><td>track2-terminology-ts-suite1-client-id</td><td>Terminology test suite 1 where the FHIR client assigns the ValueSet resource id in the setup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>track2-terminology-ts-suite2-client-id</td><td>Terminology test suite 2 where the FHIR client assigns the ValueSet resource id in the setup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>track2-terminology-ts-suite3-client-id</td><td>Terminology test suite 3 where the FHIR client assigns the ValueSet resource id in the setup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>track2-terminology-ts-suite4-client-id</td><td>Terminology test suite 4 where the FHIR client assigns the ValueSet resource id in the setup.</td></tr>
	</table>
	<h4>FHIR Resource ID Assigned by the Server</h4>
	<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1">
		<tr style="background-color:lightgray"><td><b>TestScript Name</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
		<tr><td>track2-terminology-ts-suite1-server-id</td><td>Terminology test suite 1 where the FHIR server assigns the ValueSet resource id in the setup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>track2-terminology-ts-suite2-server-id</td><td>Terminology test suite 2 where the FHIR server assigns the ValueSet resource id in the setup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>track2-terminology-ts-suite3-server-id</td><td>Terminology test suite 3 where the FHIR server assigns the ValueSet resource id in the setup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>track2-terminology-ts-suite4-server-id</td><td>Terminology test suite 4 where the FHIR server assigns the ValueSet resource id in the setup.</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>
		The main reasons for this separation are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The new DSTU-2 TestScript definition no longer contains the &lt;suite&gt; element. Without the &lt;suite&gt; element
			as a grouping mechanism it made more sense to to break up the tests into separate TestScripts.
		</li>
		<li>
			The overall separation of the original suite of tests into separate TestScript resources allows for a
			finer execution control.
		</li>
		<li>
			The &lt;setup&gt; from the original TestScript definition has been replcated to each of the new TestScript resource
			in order to follow industry best practices of each TestScript remaining independently executable.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>**</b> <i>This representation of the Terminology Services tests is not meant to be diffinitive and complete. This is
		one example of how these tests can be defined in the current DSTU-2 format of the TestScript resource.
		Constructive feedback, suggestions and critisms are welcome.</i>
